# AI-Comp-Vision
Computer vision is used in industries ranging from energy and utilities to manufacturing and automotive – and the market is continuing to grow.

## What is it??
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information.

## How does it work??
Computer vision needs lots of data. It runs analyses of data over and over until it discerns distinctions and ultimately recognize images. For example, to train a computer to recognize automobile tires, it needs to be fed vast quantities of tire images and tire-related items to learn the differences and recognize a tire, especially one with no defects.

## What tech is involved??
Two essential technologies are used to accomplish this: a type of machine learning called deep learning and a convolutional neural network (CNN).
